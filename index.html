    <h2> this is my first website</h2>

    <p>8/25 - This is my 1st journal entry. I made a website using html. We learned new commands like how to type words in bold,italicized, ect. I also learned how to add a horizontal or vertical line, how to add a picture, how to size a picture, and how to add a colored background. Recently I learned about the engineering process. For example, invention vs innovation.  </p>
<p> 9/13- This is my 2nd journal entry. This week we have started our Rub Goldsburg machine and my groups project includes a inclided plane, pulley, wheel and axil, ect. At the end of the project the result is for a car to pop a ballon.</p>

<p> 9/18- This week we built our Rube Goldburg machine. It take a few tries to do but, eventually we find a solution. In our project we used to funel but the marble would keep falling out of it so we placed a peice of cardboard to keep it from going out. We also had to make sure our slope was angled correctly so it won't have too much speed going down.</p>

<p> 9/25- This week in class we made paper boats and tried to make them float with metal scraps. Our boat lasted 3 minutes and they most likely could last longer if he added more. We also disassembled a computer and identified the parts. I learned about the CPU and RAM. Here is a picture of our computer : </p>

<p> 10/2- This week we took a computer enginnering quiz and made a functional prosthetic hand out of cardboard, string, ect. My group used carboard for the shape and added strings from the inside of the hand to pull down the fingers to use to grab objects. Making a thumb out of carboard did not work so we replaced it with a pencil as a thumb. It helped a lot with being able to grab things and hold the objects in place. Our rocket was supposed to go forward but ended going backwards.</p>

<p> 10/16- This week we learned about aerospace enginnering. We learned things like the differnet parts like the lift, thrust, drag, weight. For our project we made a rocket out of a coke bottle and launched it filled with water and pressure to give it the push/speed. </p>

<p> 10/23 -In this week we made a water bottle filter. We took a empty Coca Cola bottle that was split in half and use the top part with a pouring whole as the filter. The bottom portion was used to catch the water as the water filters. In the main filter we added cotton balls first, then we added small rocks,sand,and large rocks. As we pour the water down the filter it goes through the rocks and sand then to the cotton balls as the water drains out. We filtered the water multiple times to get as clean as possible, </p>
