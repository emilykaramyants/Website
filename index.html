    <h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>8/25 - This is my 1st journal entry. I made a website using html. We learned new commands like how to type words in bold,italicized, ect. I also learned how to add a horizontal or vertical line, how to add a picture, how to size a picture, and how to add a colored background. Recently I learned about the engineering process. For example, invention vs innovation.  </p>
<p> 9/13- This is my 2nd journal entry. This week we have started our Rub Goldsburg machine and my groups project includes a inclided plane, pulley, wheel and axil, ect. At the end of the project the result is for a car to pop a ballon.</p>
</html>
<p> 9/18- This week we built our Rube Goldburg machine. It take a few tries to do but, eventually we find a solution. In our project we used to funel but the marble would keep falling out of it so we placed a peice of cardboard to keep it from going out. We also had to make sure our slope was angled correctly so it won't have too much speed going down.</p>

<p> 9/25- This week in class we made paper boats and tried to make them float with metal scraps. Our boat lasted 3 minutes and they most likely could last longer if he added more. We also disassembled a computer and identified the parts. I learned about the CPU and RAM. Here is a picture of our computer : </p>

<p> 10/2- This week we took a computer enginnering quiz and made a functional prosthetic hand out of cardboard, string, ect. My group used carboard for the shape and added strings from the inside of the hand to pull down the fingers to use to grab objects. Making a thumb out of carboard did not work so we replaced it with a pencil as a thumb. It helped a lot with being able to grab things and hold the objects in place. Our rocket was supposed to go forward but ended going backwards.</p>

<p> 10/16- This week we learned about aerospace enginnering. We learned things like the differnet parts like the lift, thrust, drag, weight. For our project we made a rocket out of a coke bottle and launched it filled with water and pressure to give it the push/speed. </p>

<p> 10/23 -In this week we made a water bottle filter. We took a empty Coca Cola bottle that was split in half and use the top part with a pouring whole as the filter. The bottom portion was used to catch the water as the water filters. In the main filter we added cotton balls first, then we added small rocks,sand,and large rocks. As we pour the water down the filter it goes through the rocks and sand then to the cotton balls as the water drains out. We filtered the water multiple times to get as clean as possible, </p>

<p> This week inn class for electrical engineering, we worked with tinkercad and made LED circuts online. We made mulitple different types and connecting routes by following instructions that were posted on our google classroom. When the curcit was on and running the LED lights lighted up.  </p>

</p>11/27 - Bussiness Engineering ! In class we learned about bussiness engineering and thought of our own products to persent to the class. My group chose to make the "Cool kit". The Cool kit idea came to us becuase many people want conviniance in their life and that is exactly what our product gives them. It is a essential survival kit for school, it comes with objects such as vasaline, hand sanitizer, disenfective wipes, gum, bandaides, and more. The pouches are customisable to make sure each buyer is happy with the products inside. I belive these pouches are convinant because they have everything a person can possibly need during their school day, or day to day life, in case of emergancies.</p>

 <h2>The Spaghetti Bridge</h2>
 <ol type="1">
  <li>Answer to question 1: My weight of my groups bridge was 23.7 grams.</li>
  <li>Answer to question 2: The Spaghetti Bridge held 191 grams of water. </li>
  <li>Answer to question 3: The ratio for wight of bridge to weight held is 0.1241.</li>
  <li>Answer to question 4:The sides/edges of the bridge were the heaviest portions of the bridge.</li>
  <li>Answer to question 5: My groups design came together from pitching in our ideas and combining them together to make a better product at the end.</li>
  <li>Answer to question 6: The bridge come out decent at the end but there were things to be imporved. </li>
  <li>Answer to question 7: I believe the middle our base was not strong enough and thats waht caused it to snap so easily.</li>
  <li>Answer to question 8: To improve our bridge we could have used more spaghetti in the center of the bride to make it more stable and a sturdier surface. </li>

</p> 1/12- This week my group (Namika, Elaine, and I) made oobleck. It consists of cornstartch and water. When a lot of pressure is applied the substance becomes hard and the when there is little pressure appiled the substance is like a liquid. We really enjoyed making it and we got to take it with us after class too. </p>

</p> 1/22 - This week we focused on doing reascher and cadding for our mousetrap car. We made measurments on how big or small we wanted our based to be, how long the stick should be, and where we need to cut a rectangle in the base to wrap the string. Then we also did the math to figure out how many feet our car was estimated to go, which was about 24 feet. We used straws to hold the stick and wheels attached to it in place and so that they can roll. Also, we used small square peices of cardboard to keep the wheels straight and in place.

</p> My group started our second iteration by looking back at what we did right, and what we did wrong or can improve on. We recalculated the distance to make sure we did it correctly and also remeasured our dimentions of the car. This helped us realise what went wrong in sometimes situations. For example we needed a wider cut/slit into the cardboard base so that the string had more room to be wrapped and unraveled without getting stuck. We also slightly changed our string length for a longer distance. From our calculations the car was still supposed to travel about 24 feet but it in reality went to 46 feet. We are not sure what happened or changed for this effect.We also slightly changed the placement of the wheels which might of caused a slight difference.</p>

 </p> 3/4- For my group egg drop project we created a box with scraps of paper inside. Then we put a smaller box that contained the egg surronded by cotton balls for coushin. Also, we put sticks poking through the box as a break when it hit the floor. Last, we attached a trash bag with a string to the larger box to act as a parashoot. </p>

</p> 3/8- After my group and I tested the project a couple of times and fixed a few issues regarding our parashoot we felt confident that our egg would not crack. When fixing the parashoot we re-positioned the strings connecting it to the box and added a ballon inside the bag to create a space to keep the bag open. Here is a video of our project...

<p> Design - While we were designing our boat we found many different types to use as examples. We founs boats with higher sides will prevent water from seeping through the top. We made our boat short to conserve the tap and make sure water wont leak through sides or holes. Using pointed edges on both sides of a boat is the most common type. The pointed edges allow for the bot to cut through the water. It will allow us a smoother sail. Another common thing we saw was rounded bottoms but we thought it was be a challenge to be able to float. So we decided to stick with a flat bottom.  </p>

<p> Building proccess- When we started building our boat we started with measurments to make sure the cardboard seams fit perfectly so we dont have leaking. We tried our best to tape in only necessary areas since we are limited to one roll of tape. Making sure our cardboard was cut evenly is very important and if it wasnt cut evenly we went back to either fix it or re-make it. After we had all the sides and base set we started taping them toghether. We tapes both inside the boat and outside to make sure there was no water leaking. Overall at the end we still had a little less than half our roll of tape left over which we could of used to re-tape our boat more.
</p> 
<p>Results- On May 29th ( wednesday) we went to the cv swimming pool to test out our final boat project. I was really nervous and excited at the same time. Before we got into the water we quikly re-taped any spots that might of made our boat leak. We also tried taping some across the bottom. Getting into the boat was a little challenging but we did it. Once we got going it was really hard to move because our boats walls are really high up and it made it difficult to use the oars. While I was trying to push the boat across the water with my hand the boat moved a lot and we fell out. Even though our boat did not work out as we hoped I really enjoyed the whole process. Especially getting to stay in the pool afterwards ( thanks Mr. Kim :) )
