    <h2> this is my first website</h2>

    <p>8/25 - This is my 1st journal entry. I made a website using html. We learned new commands like how to type words in bold,italicized, ect. I also learned how to add a horizontal or vertical line, how to add a picture, how to size a picture, and how to add a colored background. Recently I learned about the engineering process. For example, invention vs innovation.  </p>
<p> 9/13- This is my 2nd journal entry. This week we have started our Rub Goldsburg machine and my groups project includes a inclided plane, pulley, wheel and axil, ect. At the end of the project the result is for a car to pop a ballon.</p>

<p> 9/18- This week we built our Rube Goldburg machine. It take a few tries to do but, eventually we find a solution. In our project we used to funel but the marble would keep falling out of it so we placed a peice of cardboard to keep it from going out. We also had to make sure our slope was angled correctly so it won't have too much speed going down.</p>

<p> 9/25- This week in class we made paper boats and tried to make them float with metal scraps. Our boat lasted 3 minutes and they most likely could last longer if he added more. We also disassembled a computer and identified the parts. I learned about the CPU and RAM. Here is a picture of our computer : </p>

<p> 10/2- This week we took a computer enginnering quiz and made a functional prosthetic hand out of cardboard, string, ect. My group used carboard for the shape and added strings from the inside of the hand to pull down the fingers to use to grab objects. Making a thumb out of carboard did not work so we replaced it with a pencil as a thumb. It helped a lot with being able to grab things and hold the objects in place.</p>
