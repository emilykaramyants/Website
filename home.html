    <p>8/25 - This is my 1st journal entry. I made a website using html. We learned new commands like how to type thing bold,italicized, ect. I also learned how to add a horizontal or vertical line, how to add a picture, how to size a picture, and how to add a colored background. Recently I learned about the engineering process. For example, invention vs innovation.  </p>
<p> 9/13- This is my 2nd journal entry. This week we have started our Rub Goldsburg machine and my groups project includes a inclided plane, pulley, wheel and axil, ect. At the end of the project the result is for a car to pop a ballon.</p>
