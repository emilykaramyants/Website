    <h2> this is my first website</h2>

    <p>8/25 - This is my 1st journal entry. I made a website using html. We learned new commands like how to type thing bold,italicized, ect. I also learned how to add a horizontal or vertical line, how to add a picture, how to size a picture, and how to add a colored background. Recently I learned about the engineering process. For example, invention vs innovation.  </p>
